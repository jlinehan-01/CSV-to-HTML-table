**To use:**
1. Enter data into data.csv
2. Run server.py with the current directory set to this folder
3. In a browser, go to localhost:1337

index.html currently loads from data.csv. To load from data.json, change the script to JSON_loader.js in index.html. A python script (CSVtoJSON.py) is provided to generate a JSON file from data.csv.
